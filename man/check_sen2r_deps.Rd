\usage{
check_sen2r_deps()
}
\description{
The function allows to graphically check that all the
dependencies are installed.
}
\details{
This package needs some external dependencies to run:
\itemize{
\item Python
\item GDAL
\item Wget
\item sen2cor
}

This function opens a GUI which allows to check that these dependencies
are installed. This check is highly suggested before using the library for
the fist time, in order to avoid errors.
